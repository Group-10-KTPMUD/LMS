We decided to build a desktop app named Library Management System, which help staff of a small library can manage books, members,...; borrowing and returning books.

In this project, we use some App / IDE / Framework to build:

Netbeans IDE (Java Programming Language & Java Swing)
MySQL Database
phpMyAdmin (to manage database)
Xampp Server (to create a local server)
Beside that, we use some image resources like DevianArt, Pixabay, Canva to get beautiful images and books cover.
